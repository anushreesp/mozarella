You have to get started somewhere. ~mozarella

I have always shied away from coding because I was scared of failing. 
It took me a lot of time to realize where things went wrong.

Hey, its okay to get started now! I have been in the tech industry for a while and I have made things run. 
But, I want to dig deeper and give meaning to what I do. 

I will be posting simple programs which I write to understand concepts in a simple way.

I don't gurantee that I write everything from scratch. I am learning the art of connecting the dots lying all over the web.
I can promise that the final art will be unique. 

Cheers!
